			<h1>THE DEATH OF THE AUTHOR / ROLAND BARTHES</h1>


			<p>

							<strong>In his essay, Barthes argues against the method of reading and criticism that relies on aspects of the author's identity their political views, historical context, religion, ethnicity, psychology, or other biographical or personal attributes to distill meaning from the author's work.</strong>

							<br>
							<br>

							It will always be impossible to know, for the good reason that all writing is itself this special voice, consisting of several indiscernible voices, and that literature is precisely the invention of this voice, to which we cannot assign a specific origin: literature is that neuter, that composite, that oblique into which every subject escapes, the trap where all identity is lost, beginning with the very identity of the body that writes.
				<br>
				<br>
						Mallarme's entire poetics consists in suppressing the author for the sake of the writing (which is, as we shall see, to restore the status of the reader.)
