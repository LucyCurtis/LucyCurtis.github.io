		<h1>CASUALLY PEPPER SPRAY EVERYTHING COP </h1>

<p>
On November 18th, 2011, a group of students at the University of California Davis gathered on campus for an Occupy protest, during which they formed a human chain by linking their arms together. When they refused to comply with the police request to leave, UC Davis Police officer Lieutenant John Pike and another officer walked across the the group, administering orange pepper spray straight down the line of unmoving students.

Two photoshopped versions of Macabitas’ photo surfaced on Reddit on November 20th. The first image featured Strutting Leo photoshopped over Lt. Pike. The second removed Lt. Pike, placing him in the 1819 painting Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull. The same afternoon, Lt. Pike was placed in Georges Seurat’s A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte (1884) by Tumblr blog It Makes No Sense[6] where it received over 2400 notes in a day.
