<br> art directors and

who have
been raised in a
<br> world in which the techniques
and apparatus of advertising have persistently
been presented to us as the most
<br> lucrative, effective and desirable use of our talents. Many design teachers and mentors promote this
belief;
<br> the market rewards it; a tide of books and publications reinforces it.
