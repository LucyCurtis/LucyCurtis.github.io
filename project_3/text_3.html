		<h1>POLITICAL ACTIVISM IS AS STRONG AS EVER</h1>


		<p>
			This distaste for participation in dysfunctional political systems is easily misread as apathy, leading legislators and educators to declare "a crisis in civics" as young people participate in elections at a much lower rate than their parents. But that misses a key shift: digital natives are participating in civic life in ways where they feel they can have an impact and these points of impact are often outside government.

Take Carmen Rios, 22, a student who became incensed by sexual violence in American high schools when she read about a young woman in Steubenville, Ohio who was raped by her peers, who posted photos and videos of the incident online. She decided to work with athletes, notably a Colby College football player, to address concerns that high-school athletic culture was breeding a sense of entitlement and domination that could lead to rape. They petitioned high-school sports coaches to teach sexual assault prevention as part of their work with athletes. After obtaining 70,000 signatures through online campaigns, the National Federation of State High School Associations, a national association of coaches, telephoned Rios and her fellow activists to seek their help in implementing a plan.

Or consider The Harry Potter Alliance, a group of teen and twenty-something fans of JK Rowling's books and movies, who are organising online, and search for ways to live out the values of Harry Potter and Dumbledore's army here in the muggle world. Their past campaigns have purchased thousands of books for underfunded public libraries and sent planeloads of health supplies for Haitian crisis response. Now they're working to persuade Warner Bros to buy Fairtrade chocolate for the sweets sold as tie-ins to the movies, bombarding the company with "howlers", open, digital letters that demand it consider the ethical concerns of Harry Potter's fans. Or look to the "Dream" activists, who've responded to congressional inaction on immigration reform by personalising the issue, "coming out" as "undocumented and unafraid". YouTube is filled with videos of young activists telling their stories â€“ one young woman explains that she learned she was not a US citizen only when she applied to college and discovered she would need to pay an out-of-state fee as she was a citizen of Guatemala, a country she left in infancy.
