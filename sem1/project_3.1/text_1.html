		<h1>4CHAN, THE INTERNETS OWN BOGEYMAN </h1>



		<p>
			4chan, that most elusive of Internet beasts, has seen a whole lot of press lately - little of it good. First the site was blamed for leaking the stolen nude photographs of dozens of female celebrities. Later it invented an unfunny and inexplicable â€œmascotâ€ for Ebola, and encouraged witless new iPhone owners to microwave their phones. (That latter rumor gained so much traction, the Los Angeles Police Department felt compelled to weigh in.)

			<br>
			<br>

			Apparently convinced the “ninth circle of Hell” was not doing enough to sabotage itself, shady viral marketers posing as 4chan users then pretended to hack Emma Watson’s nudes and — in the ensuing Internet-wide cacophony — demanded that 4chan be shut down.
			<br>
			<br>

“The recent 4chan celebrity nude leaks have been an invasion of privacy,” the hoaxsters railed in an open letter against 4chan, “and [are] also clear indication that the Internet NEEDS to be censored.”
<br>
<br>

How, exactly, does one anonymous Web site generate such outrage? And how can a series of wholly anonymous, time-sensitive message boards — message boards with an interface straight out of the Geocities age — have such a profound, ranging impact on the Internet at large? More importantly: Who the heck are these people, and don’t they have anything better to do?
<br>
<br>

No worries, bewildered reader. We have answers.
